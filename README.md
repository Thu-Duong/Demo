## Introduction about project

> ...they mow flawns, flip burgers, attend to the needs of babies or sick people. So when there are more migrants, the price of those services tends to go down, which helps the native workers and frees them to take on other jobs. Highly skilled women, in particular, are more likely to be able to go out to work when there are many migrants around. The entry of highly skilled women to the labor market in turn boosts demand for low-skilled labor (childcare, catering, cleaning) at home or in the firms they manage or run.

Although it has long been believed that low-skilled workers all bring negative effect on natives. Many recent empirical researchs on influx of migrants to many cities found no evidence of unambiguously negative impacts. The question about effects of low-skilled immigrants on natives has been an important part of the discussion on immigration policies in many developed countries. Using instrumental variables approach, Cortés, Patricia, and José Tessada. 2011 exploit how low-skilled workers affect time-use decision of highly-skilled native women. In this paper, the authors find that the low-skilled immigration in the 1980s and 1990s increased the working time on the market of native women in the top quartile of wage distribution by about 20 minutes a week and increase significantly the probability of women working more than 50 and 60 hours.
